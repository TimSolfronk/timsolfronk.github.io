    <div class="section-header">About me:</div>

        <div class="normal-text">
            I am a student in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
            Currently, I'm in the 5th Semester of my bachelor's degree and 
            I'm looking to finish my bachelor in the next few semesters. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Alongside my achievements at TUM, I'm also the founder of 
            <a href="https://arctictent.github.io" >Arctic Tent Studios</a>, a game company I started with a couple of fellow students. 
            Our 
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2270040/The_Kantist/">first game</a> will be published soon (later this year or at the start of next year), but a demo of it is already playable. 
            <br><br>
            Besides game development, my interests in Computer Science 
            lie mostly with Graphics Processing and Artificial Intelligence. 
            <br>
            My minor field of study is engineering, where I'm mostly focused on product design and process automation.
